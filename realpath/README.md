# Realpath

`realpath` is a useful utility function which resolves a given path with relative directories or symlinks and produces an absolute path.

This utility is part of `coreutils` on Linux but not available on OSX. With curtesy of [Adam Liss](https://stackoverflow.com/a/284664) we provide our own `realpath` implementation in C.

Use `make` to build it.
